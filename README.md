# CSINTSY MC02 - Tic Tac Toe Version 3.0
MC02. A Java Program that showcases AI capabilities competing to a Human player with the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. There are three AI levels for the Human to play with.
1. **Level 0 named Randy** - Moves randomly and doesn't take into account the past moves and players move.
2. **Level 1 named Paul** - An AI implemented using brute force if-else statements
3. **Level 2 named Rick** - The strongest AI among the three AIs and this doesn't rely on brute force algorithms.

This Machine Project was submitted to Mrs. Judith Azcarraga as partial completion for the course CSINTSY at De La Salle University. My co-worker for this project is Jordan Sibug.

## Downloading the JAR File
1. Make sure that Java is installed already (Must be Version 11 or up). You may download Java 11 [here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). No need to download JavaFX for running the JAR File.
3. Download the JAR file at https://bit.ly/CSINTSY-TicTacToe
4. After download is finished, you may run it by double-clicking the application. Treat it as an exe file.

## Running the Source Code
1. This project was built using the IntelliJ IDEA. Instructions will be clearer if executed using that IDE. Nonetheless, It should be opened through other IDEs.
2. Make sure both Java and JavaFX are installed. Download Java 11 [here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) and JavaFX 11 [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
3. You may choose to download the source code through zipping the file or cloning the repository.
4. Once done downloading, open the folder as project. Add JavaFX libraries to the Global Libraries of IntelliJ Project. Learn how to do it [here](https://youtu.be/WtOgoomDewo).
5. Run the main function located at **Driver.java** (src/tictactoe/Driver.java)

### Final Reminders
* Your computer might consider the JAR file a malware since it's a program *not widely known* since we're just students. Disregard any warnings your computer or anti-virus may say. We guarantee that our JAR file has no virus or malicious software embedded to it.
* It is very important to make sure JavaFX Libraries are included to the project if one will run the source code instead of the JAR File provided.
* The game is inspired by the popular game Among Us developed by Innersloth, art and soundtrack belongs to them and we own nothing. No copyright infringement intended. All Rights belong to InnerSloth. This is for educational purposes only.
